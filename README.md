# Football World Cup Score Board

This repository contains the result of Artiden's test case. This implementation has been developed as an example only. It is not recommended to use in real projects.
To be usable in real applications, this code needs to be tested on a more complete set of data. Also, for simplicity and just for demonstration in code, there are many simplifications that would need to be rewritten to use the appropriate tools. As an example, I can point to the  uniqid function, which is not recommended in real software. Instead, the UUID is usually used. Also, I tried to cover the necessary functionality with tests, but perhaps there are some other edge cases that have not been processed. To identify such cases, we need to conduct manual tests with a more complete set of data.
The index.php file is the main entry point to the application. The Board class simply returns an array of results, so we can use them however we like.
PHP 8.2, Composer, mockery, Docker were used for development.
If you have any questions, please write to the mail.
Thank you!
